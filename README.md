# Phone Number Details Tracker Using Python:
Overview
The Phone Number Details Tracker is a Python project that allows you to retrieve information about phone numbers. You can obtain details such as the geographic location, time zone, and carrier associated with a given phone number. Please note that this project is for educational purposes only, and any use of phone tracking should adhere to legal and ethical guidelines while respecting individuals‚Äô privacy.

# Installation:
Before getting started, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

pip install phonenumbers folium colorama opencage

The required libraries are as follows:

phonenumbers: Provides modules for working with phone numbers, including parsing, formatting, and validation.

folium: Used to generate a map displaying the approximate location of the phone number.

colorama: Adds color to the console output.

opencage: Used for geocoding (converting coordinates to a location) based on latitude and longitude.

# Usage:

# 1.Process a Phone Number: The main function in our project processes the phone number passed as input. It extracts relevant information from the phone number, such as its country code and national number. Here‚Äôs how it works:

# Python:
import phonenumbers
from colorama import init, Fore

init()  # Initialize colorama

def process_number(number):
    try:
        parsed_number = phonenumbers.parse(number)
        print(f"{Fore.GREEN}Tracking attempt for {number}:")
        print(f"International format: {phonenumbers.format_number(parsed_number, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.INTERNATIONAL)}")
        # Add more details (geolocation, carrier, etc.) here
    except phonenumbers.phonenumberutil.NumberParseException:
        print(f"{Fore.RED}Invalid phone number: {number}")

# Example usage:
process_number("+(91 650-253-0000")  # Replace with the desired phone number

# 2.Geolocation, Carrier, and Time Zone:

geocoder: Provides information about the geographic location of the phone number.

carrier: Identifies the mobile network provider associated with the phone number.

timezone: Determines the time zone in which the phone number is located.

# 3.Map Visualization (Optional): If you want to visualize the approximate location on a map, you can use the folium library. After obtaining the latitude and longitude from the geocoder, create a map marker and display it on a Folium map.

# Acknowledgments:
This project uses the phonenumbers library for phone number processing.
The opencage library is used for geocoding.

# Legal Disclaimer:

Remember that tracking someone‚Äôs phone without their explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Always respect privacy and follow legal guidelines.

 Happy coding! üìûüêç
